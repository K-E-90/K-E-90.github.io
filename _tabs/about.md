I am an Aerospace Engineer with a great interest in computer graphics. Starting my first year at the TUDelft I discovered the fun of programming. At the end of the programming course (Python) we could create a game in PyGame as a bonus assignment. This was an exciting challange at the time and it got me fascinated about the possibilities of programming.

From time to time I try to look at new techniques and tools that can speed up the workflow.

This static website was also a fun little project that was made with Jekyll and the chirpy theme.
