With an increase in UAV applications, the mission profile of the UAV can vary based on the application itself. More tasks will r... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Data Encryption Tool</title><link href="https://koenengelen.github.io/posts/Encryption/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Data Encryption Tool" /><published>2022-06-17T12:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2022-06-27T08:00:49+02:00</updated> <id>https://koenengelen.github.io/posts/Encryption/</id> <content src="https://koenengelen.github.io/posts/Encryption/" /> <author> <name>Koen Engelen</name> </author> <category term="Encryption" /> <summary> Problem Statement Recently, I required to use a USB flash drive that contained sensitive data. Therefor, it was beneficial to ensure that the stick was encrypted so that no one could read it in case it was lost. Searching for suitable tools for this task, I found BitLocker. However this tool works only on windows and third-party software is required on other operating systems to acces the en... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Interactive Shaders</title><link href="https://koenengelen.github.io/posts/GodotShaders/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Interactive Shaders" /><published>2022-04-02T12:00:00+02:00</published> <updated>2022-06-27T08:00:49+02:00</updated> <id>https://koenengelen.github.io/posts/GodotShaders/</id> <content src="https://koenengelen.github.io/posts/GodotShaders/" /> <author> <name>Koen Engelen</name> </author> <category term="Interactive Tools" /> <summary> Portal Wanting to experiment with shaders I created this portal shader. This shader can be applied to the object within a scene. If the players activates the portal, new objects apear on the other side of the portal. This is basically a transparency shader, where the mask of the shader is either expressed in global coordinates or in screen coordinates. The thing I wanted to obtain from this i... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Trajectory Tool</title><link href="https://koenengelen.github.io/posts/GodotTrajectoryTool/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Trajectory Tool" /><published>2022-03-21T11:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2022-06-27T08:00:49+02:00</updated> <id>https://koenengelen.github.io/posts/GodotTrajectoryTool/</id> <content src="https://koenengelen.github.io/posts/GodotTrajectoryTool/" /> <author> <name>Koen Engelen</name> </author> <category term="Thesis" /> <summary> Problem Statement During my thesis I had to design trajectories for my drone. These trajectories were difficult to design manually as they had to satisfy a few conditions: The trajectory should stay within position limits The trajectory should stay within velocity limits The trajectory should stay within acceleration limits The acceleration should be continuous These constraint are ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Game Server Architecture</title><link href="https://koenengelen.github.io/posts/GodotServers/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Game Server Architecture" /><published>2022-02-08T11:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2022-06-27T08:00:49+02:00</updated> <id>https://koenengelen.github.io/posts/GodotServers/</id> <content src="https://koenengelen.github.io/posts/GodotServers/" /> <author> <name>Koen Engelen</name> </author> <category term="Interactive Tools" /> <summary> Being able to interact with other people online opens up a lot of new possibilities. But creating things such as multiplayer games introduces complexities. What I wanted to learn: Client-server connection Account creation Lag compensation These were some of the things I worked on while exploring the topic of servers. Due to the experimental nature, I did not feel confident enough th... </summary> </entry> </feed>
